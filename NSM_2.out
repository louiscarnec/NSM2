\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.2}{Describe briefly your choice of graph model and how it corresponds to the real-world phenomenon, e.g. your choice of directed versus undirected edges, edge weights, allowing or disallowing self-loops, etc.}{}% 2
\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.3}{With the aid of a diagram, describe the simulation rules, e.g. how agents change state and what causes them to send messages.}{}% 3
